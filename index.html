                    Tech School Students Win National Robotics Competition
                </h3>

                </p>
                <p>
                    Students from the Advanced Robotics Department have won first place at the National Robotics
                    Challenge, competing against top institutions from across the country. The team designed and
                    programmed an autonomous rescue robot capable of navigating complex environments and identifying
                    objects using AI-powered sensors. Over several months, the students worked after school hours to
                    refine their prototype, conduct multiple test runs, and improve efficiency. Judges praised their
                    innovation, teamwork, and practical problem-solving skills. The victory not only brings national
                    recognition to the school but also highlights the strength of its hands-on, project-based learning
                    approach in engineering and robotics education.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The team’s faculty advisor commended the students for their dedication and resilience throughout the
                    competition process. Plans are already underway to further develop the rescue robot for potential
                    real-world applications in disaster response and emergency management. School administrators have
                    also announced that the winning team will mentor junior students interested in robotics, helping to
                    build a strong pipeline of future innovators.
